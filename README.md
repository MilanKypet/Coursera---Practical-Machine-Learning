# Coursera - Practical Machine Learning - Project
This is the final project of the Coursera's course Practical Machine Learning, which was developed in Jupyter Notebook.
The aim of this study is to predict the manner in which six young healthy participants perform particular exercises with dumbbells. In order to built some machine learning algorithms, we will employ a training data file in which the related outcome variable is marked as classe. The class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Finally, we select the best model for predicting 20 different test cases.
